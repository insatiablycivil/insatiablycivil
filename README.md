I'm looking for a job. I enjoy coding and solving problems a lot.

I fell in love with programming during my A-Levels doing BBC Basic project (got highest grade in Wales ðŸ‘€).

I was for whatever reason scared to apply for Computer Science and went into Civil Engineering. Regretted it.

Did an MSc in Computing, learnt Python and Software Engineering to pivot into programming.

I did my MSc dissertation using vanilla JS to force myself to learn basics of web development (https://insatiablycivil.github.io/).

Started PhD looking at "data analytics" for condition monitoring, primarily in Matlab.

Had some personal issues, took a break, returned to do a different PhD looking at uncertainty propagation, in R.

During my break, I worked as an RA using Python and R for some projects.
I am comfortable to use both, but currently most comfortable with R (maybe just recency bias).
In theory, I know Java and Matlab, but not comfortable in using them anymore.

I always thought my work / code would speak for itself. 
Didn't think that through given that basically none of my work / code is allowed to be shared...
So, forgive the unusual repositories; it's the best I can do to try and show what I did.
