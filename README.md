I'm looking for a job. I enjoy coding and solving problems a lot.
Mainly worked in Data Analytics and Machine Learning for Condition Monitoring / Asset Management in Energy Sector.
Most comfortable with Python and R. Used to do a lot in MATLAB as well.

The C57104wMCM repository is my first attempt to properly share code. As it is based on my PhD, it something I can actually publish. Please feel free to provide feedback etc if you get a chance to look at it!
